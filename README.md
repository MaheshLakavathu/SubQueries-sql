# ðŸ—‚ SQL Subqueries and Nested Queries

## âœ… Objective
Practice using subqueries (nested queries) in SQL for data retrieval, filtering, and analysis.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- Scalar subqueries
- IN and EXISTS subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Derived tables (subquery in FROM)
- Nested subqueries
- Aggregate functions inside subqueries

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `subqueries.sql` â€” SQL script containing all subquery examples.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite
- GitHub for version control

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Queries Included

- Books published after the average year (scalar subquery)
- Members who borrowed books in a specific genre (IN subquery)
- Authors with at least one book (EXISTS subquery)
- Latest book by each author (correlated subquery)
- Count of books by genre using derived table
- Members who borrowed books by a specific author (nested IN subquery)
- Books borrowed more times than the average borrow count

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open your SQL environment (DB Browser, SQLiteStudio, or MySQL Workbench).
2. Load the `subqueries.sql` file.
3. Execute queries one by one to observe how subqueries work in different clauses.
